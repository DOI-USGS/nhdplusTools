\usage{
collapse_catchments(fline_rec, cat_rec, outlets, flowline)
}
\arguments{
\item{fline_rec}{sf data.frame Reconciled flowlines as generated by `refactor_nhdplus`}

\item{cat_rec}{sf data.frame Reconciled catchments as genberated by `reconcile_catchments`}

\item{outlets}{data.frame with "ID" and "type" columns. "ID" must be identifiers from
fline and cat data.frames. "type" should be "outlet", or "terminal".
"outlet" will include the specified ID.
"terminal" will be treated as a terminal node with nothing downstream.
This parameter may change.}

\item{flowline}{sf data.frame with original nhdplus network flowlines.}
}
\description{
Collapses catchments according to a set of outlet catchments.
}
\details{
This function operates on the catchment network as a node-edge graph.
The outlet types are required to ensure that graph searches start from the
appropriate nodes and includes the appropriate catchments. Outlets such as gages
should be treated as "outlet" outlets.
While it may be possible for the algorithm to determine terminal outlets, at this
time, it is required that they be specified explicitely as "terminal" outlet types.

The function checks supplied catchment outlets to make sure they connect to downstream
catchments. This requires the original NHDPlus Flowlines' levelpathID and HydroSequence
attributes. Checks verify that the outlet of the levelpath of each supplied outlet is
in the supplied outlet set. If the outlet of a levelpath is not in the supplied set, it
is added along with other catchments that contribute to the same receiving catchment.
These checks ensure that all output catchments have one and only one input and output
nexus and that all catchments are well-connected.

Note that at this time, when a confluence has to be added to enforce network connectivity,
all tributaries to the confluence are added as catchments. This can lead to several
catchments being added to the output that may not be desired.
