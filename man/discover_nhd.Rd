\usage{
discover_nhd(
  AOI = NULL,
  comid = NULL,
  nwis = NULL,
  realization = "flowline",
  streamorder = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{AOI}{an 'area of interest' object (sf POINT or POLYGON)}

\item{comid}{Search for NHD features by COMID}

\item{nwis}{Search for NHD features by colocated NWIS identifiers}

\item{realization}{what realization to return. Default is flowline, options include: outlet, flowline, catchment, and all}

\item{streamorder}{filter returned NHD by streamorder. Returns are for given value and higher. Only usable with AOI, not with comid or nwis inputs}
}
\value{
a single, or list, or simple feature objects
}
\description{
Subsets NHD features by location (POINT), area (POLYGON), or set of COMIDs. Mutli realizations are supported allowing you to query for flowlines, catchments, or outlets.
