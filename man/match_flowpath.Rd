\usage{
match_flowpath(source_flowline, target_catchment, target_flowline)
}
\arguments{
\item{source_flowline}{sf data.frame with source flowlines and flowline attributes:
COMID, LENGTHKM, DnHydroseq, and Hydroseq, and LevelPathI or NHDPlusHR equivalents.}

\item{target_catchment}{sf data.frame with catchment polygons and FEATUREID or
NHDPlusHR equivalent.}

\item{target_flowline}{sf data.frame with target flowlines and COMID or NHDPlusHR
equivalent.}
}
\description{
Implements a flowpath matching algorithm that traces downstream along
the target flowline network and determining which levelpath from the source flowlines
best matches the resulting downstream traces. The algorithm starts from the outlet
location of the upstream most catchment in the source flowlines to stay away from
complexity that occurs near drainage divides.
