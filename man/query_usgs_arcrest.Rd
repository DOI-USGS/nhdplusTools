\usage{
query_usgs_arcrest(
  AOI = NULL,
  ids = NULL,
  type = NULL,
  where = NULL,
  t_srs = NULL,
  buffer = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{AOI}{sf (MULTI)POINT or (MULTI)POLYGON. An 'area of interest' can
be provided as either a location (sf POINT) or area (sf POLYGON)
in any Spatial Reference System.}

\item{ids}{character. A set of identifier(s) from the data
type requested, for 3dhp, this is id3dhp.}

\item{type}{character. Type of feature to return
("hydrolocation", "flowline", "waterbody", "drainage area", "catchment").
If NULL (default) a data.frame of available resources is returned}

\item{where}{character. An where clause to pass to the server.}

\item{t_srs}{character (PROJ string or EPSG code) or numeric (EPSG code).
A user specified - target -Spatial Reference System (SRS/CRS) for returned objects.
Will default to the CRS of the input AOI if provided, and to 4326 for ID requests.}

\item{buffer}{numeric. The amount (in meters) to buffer a POINT AOI by for an
extended search. Default = 0.5}
}
\value{
a simple features (sf) object or valid types if no type supplied
}
\description{
Query the USGS Hydro ESRI Rest Server for spatial data by location,
area, or ID.
}
\details{
The returned object(s) will have the same
Spatial Reference System (SRS) as the input AOI. If a individual or set of
IDs are used to query, then the default CRS of EPSG:4269 is
preserved. In all cases, a user-defined SRS can be passed to \code{t_srs}
which will override all previous SRS (either input or default).
All buffer and distance operations are handled internally using in
EPSG:5070 Albers Equal Area projection
