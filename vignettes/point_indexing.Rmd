## NHDPlus Point Indexing

First we'll load up some data. In this case, we use flowlines from the NHDPlus subset that's included in the package and a set of points to index. We'll use the NHDPlus Gages layer for this example. The data in this example is big. The R session needs a lot of memory to hold the whole NHDPlus flowline layer and run the calculations. 

```{r nhdplus_path_setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
dir.create("./data_dir")

file.copy(system.file("extdata/sample_natseamless.gpkg", 
                      package = "nhdplusTools"),
          "./data_dir/natseamless.gpkg")
```

```{r nhdplus_path, echo=TRUE}
library(nhdplusTools)

nhdplus_path("data_dir/natseamless.gpkg")

flowlines <- sf::read_sf(nhdplus_path(), "NHDFlowline_Network")
gages <- sf::read_sf(nhdplus_path(), "Gage")
```

Now we can call `nhdplusTools::get_flowline_index()` on the data we just loaded. Note that we are doing our spatial searching in units of degrees. The get_flowline_index has an input, `search_radius` which defaults to 0.1. See the documentation of the [nn2 function from the RANN package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RANN/) for more information on how the search works.

```{r get_indexes}
geom_col <- attr(gages, "sf_column")
indexes <- get_flowline_index(flowlines, gages[[geom_col]], search_radius = 0.1)
```

Now let's look at the results and see how the `nhdplusTools::get_flowline_index()` did. The below shows the percent of COMIDs and REACHCODEs that match and shows a histogram of the measure differences for the REACHCODES that were matched.

```{r analyze_index}
p_match <- 100 * length(which(indexes$COMID %in% gages$FLComID)) / nrow(gages)
paste0(round(p_match, digits = 1), 
       "% were found to match the COMID in the NHDPlus gages layer")

p_match <- 100 * length(which(indexes$REACHCODE %in% gages$REACHCODE)) / nrow(gages)
paste0(round(p_match, digits = 1), 
       "% were found to match the REACHCODE in the NHDPlus gages layer")

matched <- cbind(indexes, 
                 dplyr::select(sf::st_set_geometry(gages, NULL), 
                               REACHCODE_ref = REACHCODE, 
                               COMID_ref = FLComID, 
                               REACH_meas_ref = Measure)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(REACHCODE == REACHCODE_ref) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(REACH_meas_diff = REACH_meas - REACH_meas_ref)

hist(matched$REACH_meas_diff, breaks = 100, 
     main = "Difference in measure for gages matched to the same reach.")

round(quantile(matched$REACH_meas_diff, 
               probs = c(0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1)), 
      digits = 2)
```

The above example used the native nodes of the NHDPlus as the potential measure snap locations. The `nhdplusTools::get_flowline_index()` function has the ability to refine these by segmentizing the line to some given resolution. Let's try the same thing using a resolution of 10m and see if we can do any better. 

Note that the `sf::st_segmentize` function takes care of the distance conversion and segmentizes our lon/lat lines to 10m on the fly.

```{r get_indexes_precise}
indexes <- get_flowline_index(flowlines, 
                              gages[[geom_col]], 
                              search_radius = 0.1, 
                              precision = 10)
```

Now lets look at out comparison again.

```{r analyze_inde_precise}
p_match <- 100 * length(which(indexes$COMID %in% gages$FLComID)) / nrow(gages)
paste0(round(p_match, digits = 1), 
       "% were found to match the COMID in the NHDPlus gages layer")

p_match <- 100 * length(which(indexes$REACHCODE %in% gages$REACHCODE)) / nrow(gages)
paste0(round(p_match, digits = 1), 
       "% were found to match the REACHCODE in the NHDPlus gages layer")

matched <- cbind(indexes, 
                 dplyr::select(sf::st_set_geometry(gages, NULL), 
                               REACHCODE_ref = REACHCODE, 
                               COMID_ref = FLComID, 
                               REACH_meas_ref = Measure)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(REACHCODE == REACHCODE_ref) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(REACH_meas_diff = REACH_meas - REACH_meas_ref)

hist(matched$REACH_meas_diff, breaks = 100, 
     main = "Difference in measure for gages matched to the same reach.")

round(quantile(matched$REACH_meas_diff, 
               probs = c(0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1)), digits = 2)
```

```{r cleanup, echo = FALSE} 
unlink("data_dir", recursive = T)
```
